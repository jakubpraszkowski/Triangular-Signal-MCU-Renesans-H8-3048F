# Triangular-Signal-MCU-Renesans-H8-3048F

The main goal of the program was to generate a triangular signal. The program was supposed to work as follows:

* The generator was to be turned on and off using the kl1 and kl2 keys,

* The amplitude was to be adjusted using a potentiometer in the range of 0-0.98 with an accuracy of 0.01,

* The output waveform, i.e., our triangular signal, was to be obtained using a low-pass filter, i.e., a board that we connected to the microcontroller, along with the PWM signal setting.

* The LCD display was supposed to show the amplitude in the top left corner, the state of operation (START or STOP) in the top right corner, and the frequency F=7Hz in the bottom left corner.
